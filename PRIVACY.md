# Privacy Policy for Chatty

## 1. Introduction

Chatty is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use our application.

## 2. Data Collection and Processing

Chatty operates entirely within your web browser. We do not collect, store, or process any of your personal data or conversations on our servers.

### 2.1 Local Processing
All AI models run locally on your device. Your inputs, chat history, and any files you upload are processed entirely within your browser.

### 2.2 No Server-Side Operations
We do not send your data to any external servers for processing or storage.

## 3. Data Storage

### 3.1 Local Storage
Your chat history and any custom instructions or memory you add are stored locally in your browser.

### 3.2 Offline Functionality
Once a model is downloaded, you can use Chatty without an internet connection, further ensuring your data remains on your device.

## 4. File Uploads

When you upload files to chat with AI models, these files are processed locally and are not transmitted to any external servers.

## 5. Voice Input

If you use voice input, the speech-to-text conversion happens locally in your browser. We do not record or store your voice data.

## 6. Data Export

You can export your chat messages in JSON or Markdown format. This exported data is generated locally and is not sent to our servers.

## 7. Cookies and Tracking

Chatty does not use cookies or any tracking technologies to collect personal information about you or your usage of the application. We may use Google Analytics to understand zoomed out trends in geographic usage of the app, but will not track how you use the app or any of your personal data otherwise.

## 8. Third-Party Access

Since all data processing occurs locally, no third parties have access to your conversations or uploaded files through our application.

## 9. Data Security

While we've designed Chatty to keep your data local, please be aware that the security of data stored in your browser depends on your device's security settings and measures.
